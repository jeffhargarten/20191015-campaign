      <p>Since Sen. Amy Klobuchar's (D, Minn.) snowy Feb. 10, 2019 presidential annoucement, she's so far survived a crowded field of Democratic primary candidates, qualifying for this week's DNC primary debate as others have faltered.</p>

      <p>Headed into 2020 though, she ranks in the race's lower rungs, her poll numbers, fundraising and other metrics not resembling those of a potential party nominee. And with November's fifth Democratic debate looming on the horizon, she faces a scramble to remain on the stage.</p>

      <p>Here's Klobuchar's campaign by the numbers so far:</p>

  <div class="rule"></div>
  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Polling average</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Klobuchar has never quite reached the middle tier of candidates, and as of October, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html" target="new_">her RCP polling average</a> is stuck near the bottom of the pack. November's debate will require she reach at least 3 percent in four national or early voting state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls.</p>

  <div class="slide" id="breakdown">
      <div class="icon">1.6%</div>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Quarterly fundraising</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Klobuchar's fundraising lags considerably behind the primary's frontrunners, and in the first half of 2019 a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/how-minnesota-donors-have-boosted-klobuchar-s-campaign/506439111/">third of her small donations</a> were confined to Minnesota. <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/president/democratic-primary/candidates/fundraising-and-campaign-finance-tracker/" target="new_">Her third quarter self-reported fundraising</a> showed she hasn't gained much ground on her opponents.</p>

  <div class="slide" id="breakdown">
      <div class="icon">$4.8 million</div>
      <div class="metric">ranked 8th place</div>

  <div class="rule"></div>
  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Individual donors</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>About a third of Klobuchar's individual donor count – a key debate qualification – <a href="http://www.startribune.com/how-minnesota-donors-have-boosted-klobuchar-s-campaign/506439111/">drew from Minnesotans</a> as of mid-year FEC filings, and her donor map isn't as widespread as other candidates. Klobuchar's campaign as self-reported reaching the minimum 165,000 donor requirement for November's debate, even as equally necessary poll numbers currently elude her.</p>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Major political endorsements</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Klobuchar has secured campaign endorsements from several <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-endorsements/democratic-primary/#AmyKlobuchar" target="new_">high-profile Minnesota politicians</a>, including Gov. Tim Walz, four DFL U.S. representatives and former Vice President Walter Mondale – but hasn't yet drawn significant support from outside the state. Klobuchar sits in the middle of the pack when counting endorsements from party leaders, governors, state officials, members of Congress and mayors of large cities (like Jacob Frey in Minneapolis).</p>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Average debate time</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>As the DNC debate stage shrinks and consolidates, Klobuchar has gradually <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/politics/who-spoke-most-at-democratic-debate-september/" target="new_">made herself heard more often</a> – though her usual debate talk time is still two minutes less than average and far behind frontrunners like former Vice President Joe Biden (D, Conn.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I, Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.).</p>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Average Google search share</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Search interest for candidates ebbs and flows, and Klobuchar saw her greatest spike in Google searches surrounding the third debate in September. Overall though, averaging <a href="https://2020campaigntracker.com/#shiny-tab-search_interest" target="new_">daily Google searches</a> among Democratic candidates from April to October shows far less interest.</p>
