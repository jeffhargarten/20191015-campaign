      <p>Since Sen. Amy Klobuchar's (D, Minn.) snowy Feb. 10, 2019 presidential annoucement, she's so far survived a crowded field of Democratic primary candidates, qualifying for DNC debates at least until year's end.</p>

      <p>Headed into 2020 though, she ranks in the race's lower rungs, her poll numbers, fundraising and other metrics not resembling those of a potential party nominee.</p>

      <p>Here's Klobuchar's campaign by the numbers so far:</p>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Polling average</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Klobuchar's has never quite reached even the middle tier of candidates, and as of mid-October 2019, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html">her RCP polling average</a> is stuck near the bottom of the pack.</p>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Individual donors</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Individual small donors are a key factor to making the DNC debate stage, and though Klobuchar qualifies through November, a significant portion of her campaign's financial support <a href="http://www.startribune.com/how-minnesota-donors-have-boosted-klobuchar-s-campaign/506439111/">draws from Minnesotans</a>, which doesn't expand the map compared to other candidates.</p>
     </section> 
  <div class="slide" id="breakdown">
      <div class="icon">79,000</div>
      <div class="metric">ranked 11th place</div>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Campaign fundraising</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Klobuchar's fundraising lags considerably behind the primary's frontrunners, and in the first quarter of 2019 a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/how-minnesota-donors-have-boosted-klobuchar-s-campaign/506439111/">third of her small donations</a> were confined to Minnesota. <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/president/democratic-primary/candidates/fundraising-and-campaign-finance-tracker/" target="new_">Her second quarter FEC filing</a> showed a drop from the $9 million previously raised by the campaign.</p>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Political endorsements</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Klobuchar has secured campaign endorsements from <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-endorsements/democratic-primary/#AmyKlobuchar">high-profile Minnesota politicians</a> – including the governor, four DFL U.S. representatives and former Vice President Walter Mondale – but hasn't yet received key endorsements from those outside the state.</p>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Average debate time</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>As the DNC debate stage has shrunken and consolidated since the summer, Klobuchar has gradually made herself heard more often – though her usual debate talk time is still two minutes less than average and lags behind frontrunners like former Vice President Joe Biden (D, Conn.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I, Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.).</p>

  <h2 class="chartTitle" id="trigger">Average Google search share</h2>
  <section class="container-lg leadin">
      <p></p>
     <p>Search interest for candidates ebbs and flows, and Klobuchar saw her greatest spike in Google searches after the third debate. Overall though, <a href="https://2020campaigntracker.com/#shiny-tab-search_interest" target="new_">daily searches from January to September</a> show she's lagged far behind other candidates.</p>
